### Development Enviornment  
  
#### 1. Download the Go distribution from the official website.  
  
The Go distribution and tooling is available as an installer for all common operating systems. Visit <https://golang.org/dl/> to download to correct version for your OS. The installation instructions can be found
[here](https://golang.org/doc/install).  
  
#### 2. Download and install NPM.  
  
NPM and Node.js can be downloaded from their [official website](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). Simply select your  
distribution/OS and CPU architecture.

Note: node12 should be used. (It's recommended to use nvm and switch to node12)
  
#### 3. Install Wails  
  
The Molly Wallet is built using a light-weight framework for Desktop Applications using Go and VueJS. [Wails](https://github.com/wailsapp/wails) is very similar to Electron but does not include the full Chromium web browser as a dependency.  

Note: don't use the latest wails version, instead install an older version:
`go install github.com/wailsapp/wails/cmd/wails@v1.8.0`
