The Molly Wallet is the official $DAG wallet of the Constellation Network. It'll let users interact with the Hypergraph  
Network in various ways, not limited to producing $DAG transactions. The wallet is currently under development, the firs  
t public release has been shipped with more to come.  
  
### Here's how the Constellation Team describes it on their website  
  
>Created by a Constellation community member, for the best community in crypto, and named after the wallet designer’s da  
ughter, Molly is built with a vision to set future standards in digital commerce.  
  
>Just like your wallet that you use daily to pay for lunch, dinner, clothes, that hold your business cards, ID’s, and th  
at lucky penny, our intention was to design something that people would use everyday. We live in an age where we have an  
abundance of information, from videos to blogs, that are at our fingertips. Digital commerce is molding how generations  
interact with one another, consume, and educate themselves. The nature of this wallet is digital and thus we wanted to  
expand the possibilities of what a wallet could be and do because of its multimedia capabilities. We wanted to make it n  
ot only user friendly, but create the space for applications to be developed by our vibrant open source community.  
  
>A true articulation of open innovation.  
  
>A cryptocurrency wallet is one of the most cherished pieces of technology to anyone that holds cryptocurrency. Yet many  
wallets are visually unappealing, have limited functionality and utility, and are treated as an afterthought. We wanted  
to bring it to the forefront and reimagine the wallet, the community that uses the wallet, and enable a future that wil  
l be powered by DAG.
